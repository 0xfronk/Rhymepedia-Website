## Types

```
type options {
	title: string;
	artist: string;
	apiKey: string;		// Genius developer access token

	url: string;		// Genius webpage URL for the song
	lyrics: string;		// Song lyrics
	albumArt: string;	// URL of the album art image (jpg/png)
}

```

```
type searchResult {
	id: number;		// Genius song id
	url: string;		// Genius webpage URL for the song
	title: string;		// Song title
